# Maps Over Void

This template provides a minimal setup for map enthusiasts, featuring OpenStreetMap, Mapbox satellite tiles, Google Photorealistic Tiles, and enhanced interactions with R3F, all within the same context.

Currently, two map providers are available:

Minimal map, Asia  
Map data by OpenStreetMap

Using OpenStreetMap’s minimalist base map, suitable for blending tools on the map. I want to have my own wiki POI, but I don’t have time for it right now.

I have always greatly appreciated Mapbox’s map style—it’s thoughtfully designed, features the best color schemes, and even the typography feels just right. Here, Mapbox satellite tiles are used as the outdoor map.

Prague, Czech Republic  
Map data by Google Photorealistic Tiles

If the high cost of Photorealistic Tiles is prohibitive, try Sentinel3 instead.
